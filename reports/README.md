# Report output

Some of the analyses steps are performed in R Markdown/Jupyter.

For each such case, a static version of the most recent output is provided here.

**Contents**:

- "_phosphoproteomics.pdf_" - Phosphoproteomics functional enrichment analysis
- "_summary.pdf_" - Transcriptomics & Phosphoproteomics summary and comparison
- "_summary-pubmed-mtor.pdf_" - Modified summary report used to visualize mTOR literature associations 
- "_summary-pubmed-hippo.pdf_" - Modified summary report used to visualize Hippo literature associations 
- "_pubmed.pdf_" - PubMed Hippo/mTOR literature analysis

The transcriptomics functional enrichment analysis was incorporated into the make transcriptomics
Snakemake pipeline, and as such, has no associated PDF summary report as was created for the
phosphoproteomics analysis.
